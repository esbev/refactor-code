# Challenge Week 1

## Description
Here I used existing code from the client to take the their needs and adjust the code accordingly. This project was build to take client's needs and translate that into updated code on the current website. This project solves some functionality issues on the client website and updates the current code on the .html and .css files using semantic code with appropriate commenting. Here I was able to gain a glimpseof what it is like debug existing code and locate opportunities for improved readability and flow.
