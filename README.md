# Name

## Description

Here I used preexisting code from the client to work through the client's needs and adjust the code accordingly. This project was build to take client needs and translate that into updated code on the current client website. This project solves some functionality issues on the client website and updates the current code on the .html and .css files with semantic and cleaner code. I learned how to look at someone else's code and debug and find places where code can be improved for readability flow.
