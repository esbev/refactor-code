## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?

Here I used preexisting code from the client to work through the client's needs and adjust the code accordingly. This project was build to take client needs and translate that into updated code on the current client website. This project solves some functionality issues on the client website and updates the current code on the .html and .css files with semantic and cleaner code. I learned how to look at someone else's code and debug and find places where code can be improved for readability flow.
